## Challenge #1: Automating Christmas gift wrapping!

### Instructions

This year the elves have bought a gift wrapping machine. But... it's not programmed! We need to create an algorithm that helps it in the task.

The machine receives an array with the gifts. Each gift is a string. We need the machine to wrap each gift in wrapping paper and place it in an array of wrapped gifts.

The wrapping paper is the * symbol and to wrap a gift the * symbol is placed so that it completely surrounds the string on all sides. For example:

```js
const gifts = ['book', 'game', 'socks']
const wrapped = wrapping(gifts)
console.log(wrapped)
/* [
  "******\n*book*\n******",
  "******\n*game*\n******",
  "*******\n*socks*\n*******"
] */
```

As you can see, the wrapping paper wraps the string. On top and bottom, so as not to leave any gaps, the corners are also covered with wrapping paper.

Good luck!
